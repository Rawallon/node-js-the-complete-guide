# Wrap Up

## SQL

- SQL uses strict data schemas and relations

- Its possible to connect using libraries like mysql

- Writing SQL queries is not directly related to Node, but rather its own language

## Sequilize

- Instead of writing SQL queries manually, ORMs like Sequelize allows to focus on the business logic working with native JS objects

- Sequelize allows for defining the schema, easily setting up relations (associations) through them allowing for a easier interaction
