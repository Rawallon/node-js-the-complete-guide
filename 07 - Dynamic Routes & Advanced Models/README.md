# Wrap Up

## Dynamic Routing

- A dynamic path can be passed by adding a ": to the Express router path

- The name you add after ":" is the name by which you can extract the data on req.params

- Optional queries parameters can be also passed and extracted

## More on models

- A cart model was model was added - it holds static methods only

- You can interact between models (ex: delete cart if a product is deleted)

- Working with files for data storage is suboptimal for bigger amounts of data
