# Wrap Up

## Mongoose

It is a ORM for Mongo (, ODM in this case), similar to what Sequelize (from previous module) is to SQL DBs, in short, it allows to work with data instead of queries, allowing to focus business logic

## Core concepts

Schemas and models are use to define what the data should look like

Instances are JS objects based on schemas

Queries are ran on Instancies to be able to query the DB but with Mongoose's helpers and syntactical sugar
