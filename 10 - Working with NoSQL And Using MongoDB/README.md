# Wrap Up

## NoSQL / MongoDB

- Alternative to SQL databases
- No strict schemas, fewer relations
- Its possible to use a reference-based relations but it's not the only way
- Often, relations are also created by embedding other documents / data

## Working with MongoDB

- Use the official MongoDB Driver
- Commands like insertOne(), find(), updateOne() and deleteOne() make CRUD operations very simple
- Check the official docs to learn about all avaliable operations + configurations / operators
- All operations are promise-based, hence you can easily chain them for more complex flows
