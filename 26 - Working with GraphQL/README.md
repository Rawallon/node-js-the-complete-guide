# Wrap Up

## GraphQL Core Concepts

- Stateless, client-indepent API.
- Higher flexibility than REST API offer due to custom query language that is exposed to the client.
- Queries(GET), Mutations(POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE) and Subscriptions can be used to exchange and manage data.
- ALL GraphQL request are directed to ONE endpoint.
- The server parses the incoming query expression (typically done by third-pary packages) and calls the appopiate resolvers.
- GraphQL is NOT limited to React.js Apps.

## GraphQL vs REST

- REST APIs are great for static data requirements
- GraphQL gives you higher flexibility by exposing a full query language to the client
- Both RESTand GraphQL APIs can be implemented in ANY framework on both ends
